// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

SELECT number1
FROM number_list

SELECT number2
FROM number_list

SUM(number1,number2)


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

EVEN = number1,number1
ODD = number1,number2

IF number FROM number_list = EVEN = even
IF number FROM number_list = ODD = odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

SELECT number1,number2,number3,number4,number5
FROM number_list

AVG(number1,number2,number3,number4,number5)

MIN(number1,number2,number3,number4,number5)

MAX(number1,number2,number3,number4,number5)

“Select numbers1-5 from the number list column”
“Find the average of numbers1-5”
“Find the minimum of numbers1-5”
“Find the maximum of numbers1-5”
